My personal online resume, built on the Next.js framework, is a dynamic showcase of my qualifications and skills. Featuring a private route for recruiters, it securely fetches confidential information like contact details from a private gist. Recruiters can download a PDF version of my CV and utilize a unique skill highlighting tool powered by OpenAI, enabling them to input job offers and automatically highlight relevant keywords on my webpage. To maintain fairness, the API supporting this feature includes a rate limiter with Redis, allowing recruiters up to 3 accesses per day. This project not only demonstrates technical proficiency but also prioritizes privacy, accessibility, and innovation in the recruitment process.
