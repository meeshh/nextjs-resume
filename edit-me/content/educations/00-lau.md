During my Computer Science degree, I gained a strong foundation in both basic and advanced concepts. Courses like Object-Oriented Programming and Algorithms sharpened my design and problem-solving skills. I delved into computer architecture in Computer Organization, and System functionality in Operating Systems. The Theory of Computation expanded my theoretical knowledge, while Computer Networks offered insights into interconnected systems. Database Management Systems taught effective database design, and Parallel Programming optimized my skills for multicore systems. My capstone project focused on predicting diabetes in newborns using the C4.5 algorithm, merging theoretical and practical knowledge. The Professional Experience course integrated theory with hands-on practice, providing a holistic understanding of computer science.
